     The Modern art period began in the 1860's and lasted all the way umtil 1975. It enotes the styles and philosophies of the art produced during that era.
     he term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation. 
     Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials 
     and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, 
     toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called 
     contemporary art or postmodern art.
